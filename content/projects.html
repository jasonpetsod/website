### <a name="eduken">eduKEN</a>

[eduKEN](http://www.edukenvideo.com) is a video annotation and indexing system
that allows its users to watch videos and post comments associated with
various points in the video. Comments are thus contextualised with particular
video segments. Additionally, instead of relying on traditional video metadata
such as its title, description, and tags, comments are used to augment search
results since they are representative of the video's actual content.

The project started as an [IPRO project](http://ipro.iit.edu) to
improve interactivity among students watching lectures online and sought to
better replicate the interaction found in a live, in-person classroom. It was
the
[winner](http://ipro.iit.edu/uncategorized/ipro-day-winning-teams-fall-2009)
in its track (Track 2: Information Technology Solutions).

### <a name="gears">gears</a>

A command-line interface for the
[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) BitTorrent client.

### <a name="frankenplot">frankenplot</a>

frankenplot is a simple and easy-to-use Python application for plotting
[MRCAT](http://mrcat.iit.edu/) x-ray fluorescence mapping data. Its
functionality was improved upon during the Spring 2010 semester as part of a
research project at the Illinois Institute of Technology with Professor [Carlo
Segre](http://www.iit.edu/~segre) and Ken McIvor.

### <a name="amd64">&#8220;The Scalability of the AMD64 Architecture&#8221;</a>

A [student inquiry](http://www3.imsa.edu/learning/inquiry) project conducted
in [high school](http://www.imsa.edu) to examine the scalability of the
newly-released x86&ndash;64 architecture. We used commodity off-the-shelf
components and tested [OpenMOSIX](http://openmosix.sourceforce.net), ray
tracing with [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/), video encoding using
[dvd::rip](http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/doc/index.cipp), and distributed
compilation with [distcc](http://distcc.samba.org/) in one-, two-, three-, and
four-node configurations. We found that there was nearly linear scaling on
pure computation tasks (ray tracing, video encoding, etc.) but diminishing
returns on I/O-bound tasks (distcc). Presented at the [Twelfth Annual NCSSSMST
Student Research
Symposium](http://www.ncsssmst.org/userViewSelectedConference.aspx?CNF_ID=10050)
(June 2005).

### <a name="sup-web">sup-web</a>

An in-progress web interface for the [sup](http://sup.rubyforge.org/) mail
client using the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web framework.
