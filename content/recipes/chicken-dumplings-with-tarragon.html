### Ingredients

 * 5 lb chicken thighs; bone in, skin on
 * salt and pepper
 * 4 tbsp canola oil
 * 4 tbsp butter
 * 2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, sliced in half lengthwise
   and then cut into 1/4 inch pieces
 * 1 large onion, finely chopped
 * 4 cloves garlic, minced
 * 6 tbsp all-purpose flour
 * 1/4 cup dry sherry
 * 4 cups chicken broth
 * 1/2 cup water
 * 1/4 cup heavy cream
 * small bunch of thyme, tied together with kitchen string
 * 2 or 3 bay leaves
 * 1 cup frozen green peas
 * 3 tbsp fresh tarragon leaves, minced

#### Dumplings

 * 2 cups all-purpose flour
 * 1 tbsp baking powder
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 3 tbsp reserved chicken fat

### Procedure

 1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and then season on both
 sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
 
 1. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large Dutch oven on medium high for 2 minutes.

 1. Brown chicken thighs in batches. Add chicken skin-side down and cook until
 browned on each side. Remove and set aside. Repeat until all chicken has been
 browned.

 1. Pour off the chicken fat left in the pot and reserve. 
 
 1. Add the butter and melt over medium high heat. 
 
 1. Add the leeks and onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until softened,
 about 7 minutes. 
 
 1. Put in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.  

 1. Add the flour, stirring to coat the vegetables. Then add the sherry,
 scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. 
 
 1. Stir in the broth, water, milk, thyme bundle, and bay leaves.  

 1. Nestle the chicken into the pot and pour in any accumulated juices. Cover,
 crank the heat to high, and bring to a boil. 
 
 1. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the
 chicken is fully cooked and tender.

 1. Using a pair of tongs, transfer the chicken to a rimmed baking sheet, and
 let cool slightly. Remove the chicken from the bones and shred into
 bite-sized pieces.

 1. Return the chicken to the stew, add in the peas and tarragon, and bring to
 a simmer over medium heat. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

 1. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and baking
 powder. Microwave the chicken fat and milk in a small heat-proof bowl just
 until warm. Do not over heat. Add the warm milk mixture and the tarragon into
 the flour mixture and stir until incorporated and smooth.

 1. Gather a small golf-ball-sized portion of dough onto a soup spoon and then
 using a second spoon, push the dumpling off into the stew.  Continue until
 all the dough is used up.  

 1. Cover and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes until the dumplings have
 doubled in size.

 1. Serve in wide, shallow bowls with a couple grindings of black pepper.
 Minced fresh parsley might be nice and/or maybe a little extra chopped
 tarragon.
