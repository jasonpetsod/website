### Ingredients

 * 4&ndash;4.5 lb chicken
 * salt and pepper
 * 6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
 * 6 thyme sprigs
 * 3 medium-sized rutabagas (also called "swedes"), ends cut and discarded,
   peeled and any outer tough layer discarded, then cut into 3/4-inch wedges
 * 2 medium-sized turnips, prepared the same way as the rutabagas
 * 4 medium-sized carrots, peeled and cut in 2-inch segments
 * 1 small yellow onion, peeled, roots cut off but core kept intact, other end
   cut off and discarded, then cut into quarters
 * 1 leek, white and light green parts only, sliced in half lengthwise
   and then cut into 1/4 inch pieces
 * 8 small red-skinned new potatoes
 * 1/3 cup olive or grapeseed oil
 * 4 tbsp butter, room temperature

### Equipment

 * large (11-inch if you have it) oven-proof frying pan
 * kitchen string

### Procedure

 1. Leave the chicken in the refrigerator uncovered (on a plate and not
 touching anything else in the fridge) for 1&ndash;2 days after buying it so
 that the skin gets a bit dried out.

 1. 1.5 to 2 hours before it goes in the oven, put chicken on a plate on the
 kitchen counter to come to room temperature (about 70&deg;F). Remove the
 neck and giblets from the cavity of the chicken (save for stock).

 1. Preheat oven to 475&deg;F.

 1. Use a paring knife to cut away the wishbone from the neck/breast area of
 the chicken. You will probably have to use your fingers to feel around for
 it. This is a little bit tricky, but if you can remove the wishbone first, it
 will make the chicken easier to carve after it is cooked. (This ease of
 future carving is the only reason to take the bone out, so you can leave it
 in if you want.)

 1. Generously season the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper. Add
 three of the garlic cloves and 5 sprigs of the thyme to the cavity, using
 your hands to rub the thyme and garlic all around the cavity.

 1. Truss the chicken with kitchen string. To do so, start by cutting a 3-foot
 section of cotton kitchen string. Place the chicken so that it is breast up,
 and the legs pointing toward you. Tuck the wing tips under the chicken. Wrap
 the string under the neck end of the bird, pulling the string ends up over
 the breast, toward you, plumping up the breast. Then cross the string under
 the breast (above the cavity and between the legs). Wrap each end around the
 closest leg end, and tie tightly so that the legs come together. (See

 Recipes](http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/kellers_roast_chicken/).)

 1. Place the vegetables, onions, garlic, and remaining thyme sprig into a
 bowl. Add 1/4 cup of olive oil (or grapeseed oil) and toss until well coated.
 Season generously with salt and pepper.

 1. Slather the chicken with oil and season well with salt and pepper.

 1. Create a bed of the root vegetables in a large cast iron pan Slather the
 top of the chicken breasts with butter. 

 1. Place the pan in the oven and roast the chicken for 25 minutes at
 475&deg;F. Then reduce the heat to 400&deg;F and roast for an additional 45
 minutes, or until the thickest part of the thigh registers 160&deg;F on a
 meat thermometer and the juices run clear.

 1. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, cover with aluminum foil and let
 rest for 20 minutes before carving to serve. Keep the vegetables warm by
 keeping them in the now-turned-off oven while the chicken is resting. Stir to
 coat the vegetables with the cooking juices before serving.

 1. Cut the chicken into serving pieces. Place vegetables on a serving platter
 with the chicken pieces arranged on top.
