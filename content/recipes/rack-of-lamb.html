### Ingredients

 * 2 lamb racks with 8 ribs each (3 to 4 pounds total)
 * salt and pepper
 * 8 sprigs rosemary and/or thyme
 * 2 medium shallots, roughly chopped
 * 4 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped
 * 1 tbsp olive oil
 * 1 tbsp canola oil

### Equipment

 * zip-loc bags
 * cooler

### Procedure

 1. Season lamb generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Place inside two
 gallon-sized zip-loc bags along with aromatics and olive oil. Marinate in
 refrigerator for at least a few hours.
 
 1. Squeeze out as much air from bags as possible with hands and close zipper
 lock, leaving one-inch un-sealed. Slowly submerge bags in large pot of water,
 until only sealing edge of bags is exposed. Any remaining air should be
 forced out of bag as it is submerged. Seal bag completely. Repeat with
 remaining bags, then set all bags aside.

 1. Heat at least two gallons of water on the stovetops to 130&deg;F for
 medium rare or 145&deg;F for medium, using instant-read thermometer to ensure
 temperature accuracy. Pour water into cooler.

 1. Add lamb to cooler, seal, and set it warm spot for at least 45 minutes,
 and up to three hours. 
 
 1. Check the temperature of the water after 15 minutes to ensure that it
 isn't losing heat too rapidly. It should lose at most 1&deg;F after 15
 minutes; if it has lost more, top up with boiling water, and drape cooler
 with several bath towels to help insulate.

 1. Remove lamb racks from bags, discard aromatics (if using), and pat dry
 with paper towels.

 1. Heat canola oil in heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking.
 
 1. Add lamb to skillet fat-side down and sear until well-browned on all
 sides, turning with tongs as necessary, about 5 minutes total.
 
 1. Tent seared lamb with foil, allow to rest 5 minutes, carve, and serve.
