### Ingredients

 * 4 duck legs or 1 duck, cut into quarters
 * salt and pepper
 * 1 large onion, sliced
 * 1 tbsp ginger, minced
 * 1 tbsp garlic, minced
 * 2 [Thai peppers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_pepper), minced
 * 1 1/2 lb green beans, trimmed
 * 1 tbsp sugar, or to taste
 * 2 tbsp nam pla
 * 2 tbsp lime juice, or to taste
 * coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves for garnish, optional

### Procedure

 1. Season duck with salt and pepper. Put it in a skillet that will fit it
 comfortably, turn heat to medium, and cover.

 1. Once you hear sizzling, duck should be simmering in its own fat and
 exuding liquid. Adjust heat to create a steady simmer.

 1. Once bottom browns, turn. Eventually liquid will evaporate and duck will
 cook in fat only. At this point, turn heat to low and continue to cook duck,
 turning once in a while, until it becomes tender, about an hour.

 1. Transfer duck to a plate. Pour off all but a couple of tablespoons of fat.
 
 1. Turn heat to medium high, and add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until
 it softens, about 5 minutes. 
 
 1. Add ginger, garlic, and peppers and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. 
 
 1. Add beans and sugar and turn heat to high; cook, stirring occasionally,
 until beans begin to brown, about 5 minutes.

 4. Add 2 tablespoons water and nam pla. Put duck on top of bean mixture and
 bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until both beans and duck are very tender,
 15 to 30 more minutes, adding a little more water if necessary to keep
 mixture moist. (You can prepare dish in advance up to this point; cover and
 set aside until ready to eat, then reheat.) 
 
 1. Uncover and stir in lime juice; taste and adjust seasoning, then sprinkle
 with cilantro and serve.
