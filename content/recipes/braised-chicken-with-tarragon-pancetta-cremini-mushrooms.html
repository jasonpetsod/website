### Ingredients

 * 3 1/4 pounds of chicken (preferably thighs and legs)
 * all-purpose flour (for coating)
 * olive oil
 * 2 thick slices pancetta (about 5 ounces); can substitute bacon
 * 2 leeks, sliced and cleaned
 * 4 cloves garlic, minced
 * 7 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced or quartered
 * 2 1/2 cups chicken stock
 * 1 cup white wine
 * 1/2 cup cream
 * 1 tablespoon tarragon, chopped
 * 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped
 * salt and pepper

### Procedure

 1. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken pieces and then dredge the in
 flour and shake off any excess.
 
 1. Add oil to large, deep saut&eacute; pan on medium for 2 minutes.
 
 1. Brown chicken thighs in batches. Add chicken skin-side down and cook until
 browned on each side. Remove and set aside. Repeat until all chicken has been
 browned.

 1. Add more oil if necessary and cook the pancetta until crisp. Remove and
 set aside. 
 
 1. Add the garlic, leeks, and mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Cook
 until leeks are soft and mushrooms are golden. Remove and set aside.

 1. Combine the chicken stock and wine in the pan. Bring to a simmer, scraping
 up any brown bits from the base of the pan if there are any. Turn down the
 heat a little, return the chicken to the pan and simmer, covered, for 25
 minutes.

 1. Add the pancetta and the leek, garlic, and mushroom mixture as well as the
 cream, tarragon, and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for a further 5 minutes or
 until reduced and thickened.

 1. Sprinkle the chicken with the chopped parsley and serve in a wide, shallow
 bowl with something to soak up the creamy sauce, like couscous, potatoes, or
 steamed basmati rice.
