### Ingredients

 * 3 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting
 * 1/4 tsp instant yeast
 * 1 1/4 tsp salt
 * 1.5 cups water

### Procedure

 1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast, and salt.

 1. Add water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. 
 
 1. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably
 about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70&deg;F.

 1. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a
 work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and
 fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
 rest about 15 minutes.

 1. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to
 your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. 
 
 1. Line a bowl with parchment paper and generously coat with flour. 

 1. Put dough seam side down on paper and dust with more flour. Cover with
 parchment paper and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will
 be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with
 a finger.

 1. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450&deg;F. Put a
 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex, or ceramic) in oven
 as it heats. 
 
 1. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under
 towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess,
 but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it
 will straighten out as it bakes. 
 
 1. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes. 
 
 1. Remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully
 browned. Cool on a rack.
