### Ingredients

 * 2 steaks, 1.25--1.5 inches thick
 * canola or peanut oil
 * salt and pepper
 * garlic
 * butter

### Procedure

 1. Sprinkle both sides of both steaks liberally with salt and pepper. Let sit
 at room temperature for 1 hour per inch of thickness.

 1. Rinse all salt off on both sides and pat very dry with paper towels.
 Season with pepper and garlic (no salt is needed).

 1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275&deg;F.

 1. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Cook until
 instant-read thermometer reads 90--95&deg;F for rare to medium-rare (20
 to 25 minutes) or 100--105&deg;F degrees for medium (25 to 30 minutes).

 1. Heat oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking.

 1. Place steaks in skillet and sear steaks until well-browned and crusty,
 about 1.5 to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through to redistribute fat
 underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins to burn.) 
 
 1. Turn steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 2 to 2.5 minutes.
 Reduce heat to medium and sear steaks on their sides until browned, about 1.5
 minutes.

 1. Transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest for 10 minutes, loosely
 tented with foil. Top with butter.

 1. Serve immediately.
