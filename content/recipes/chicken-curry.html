### Ingredients

 * 2 tbsp canola oil
 * 2 lb chicken thighs, cut into vaguely bite-sized pieces
 * salt and pepper
 * 1 large onion; half chopped, half thinly sliced
 * 3 cloves of garlic, minced
 * 1 tbsp ginger, peeled and minced
 * 1 1/2 cup coconut milk (can substitute yogurt for some or all)
 * 1/2 cup chicken stock
 * cilantro leaves, minced

#### Spices

 * 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
 * 1/8 tsp nutmeg
 * 3 cloves
 * 1/3 tsp cardamom seeds
 * 1-inch cinnamon stick (substitution: 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon)
 * 4 tsp cumin seeds
 * 5 tsp coriander seeds

 * 1 tsp ground ginger
 * 2 tsp ground tumeric
 * 1/2 tsp ground cayenne (less if you're spice-averse)

### Procedure

 1. Toast and grind first seven spices. Mix in ginger, tumeric, and cayenne.
 Set aside. (If whole spices aren't available, substitute ground versions and
 don't toast. Also, a zip-loc bag and a rolling pin can be used as a grinder
 in a pinch.)

 1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in large, deep skillet that can later be
 covered.

 1. Brown chicken chunks in batches, seasoning with salt and pepper as they
 cook, about 8 minutes per batch.

 1. Remove chicken and discard all but 2 tbsp of fat.

 1. Cook sliced onions over medium heat until golden brown, about 6 minutes.

 1. Add chopped onion, garlic, ginger, and spices. Stir and cook over medium
 heat for 3 to 4 minutes until chopped onion softens.

 1. Return chicken to pot. Add 1 cup of coconut milk and all of the stock,
 scraping off the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. The mix might look
 a little dry, but that should be fine; we're adding more coconut milk at the
 end. Bring to a boil.

 1. Cover and turn heat to low. Simmer until chicken is tender and cooked
 through, at least 1 hour.

 1. Remove the cover. If the mixture is soupy, turn heat to high and reduce it
 a bit. Taste and adjust seasoning.

 1. Stir in remaining coconut milk. Serve with steamed jasmine or basmati
 rice, garnished with cilantro.
