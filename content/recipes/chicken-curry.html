### Ingredients

 * 2 tbsp canola oil
 * 2 lb chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces
 * salt and pepper
 * 2 cups onions, thinly sliced
 * 1 cup onions, chopped
 * 1 tbsp garlic, minced
 * 1 tbsp ginger, peeled and minced
 * 1 1/4 cup coconut milk (10 oz; usually 1 can)
 * 1/2 cup chicken stock
 * 1/4 cups yogurt
 * cilantro leaves, minced

#### Spices

 * 1 tsp black peppercorns
 * 1/4 tsp nutmeg
 * 3 cloves
 * 1/3 tsp cardamom seeds
 * 1-inch cinnamon stick (substitution: 1 tsp ground cinnamon)
 * 3 tsp cumin seeds
 * 4 tsp coriander seeds

 * 1 tsp ground ginger
 * 2 tsp ground tumeric
 * 1/2 tsp ground cayenne

### Procedure

 1. Toast and grind first seven spices. Mix in ginger, tumeric, and cayenne. Set
 aside. (If whole spices aren't available, substitute ground versions and
 don't toast.)

 1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in large, deep skillet that can later be
 covered.

 1. Brown chicken chunks in batches, seasoning with salt and pepper as they
 cook.

 1. Remove chicken and discard all but 2 tbsp of fat.

 1. Cook sliced onions over medium heat until golden brown, stirring
 occasionally.

 1. Add chopped onion, garlic, ginger, and spices. Stir and cook over medium
 heat for 3 to 4 minutes until chopped onion softens.

 1. Return chicken to pot. Add 1 cup of coconut milk and all of the stock.
 Bring to a boil.

 1. Cover and turn heat to low. Simmer until chicken is tender, at least 1
 hour.

 1. Remove the cover. If the mixture is soupy, turn heat to high and reduce it
 a bit. Taste and adjust seasoning.

 1. Stir in yogurt and remaining coconut milk. Serve, garnished with cilantro.
