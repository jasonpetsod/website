### Ingredients

 * 1 leg of lamb, 5&ndash;7 lb
 * salt and pepper
 * 2 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed
 * 1 tbsp garlic, minced
 * 1 tbsp rosemary, minced
 * 2 lbs potatoes, cut into 1.5-inch chunks
 * 4 carrots, peeled and cut into 1.5-inch chunks
 * 2 onions, quartered
 * 1/2 cup chicken, beef, or vegetable stock, plus more as needed

### Procedure

 1. Preheat oven to 425&deg;F.

 1. Remove as much of the surface fat as possible from the lamb. 
 
 1. Use a thin-bladed knife to cut some small slits in the lamb and push a bit
 of the spices in them. Rub the lamb all over with the remaining spices.

 1. Let lamb sit for an hour or so (refrigerate if it'll be much longer).

 1. Place in roasting pan and scatter vegetables around it. Moisten with 1/2
 cup of stock.

 1. Place in oven for 30 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350&deg;F. Check
 the vegetables: if they're dry, add another 1/2 cup of stock.

 1. After 1 hour of roasting, start checking the internal temperature of the
 lamb every 10 minutes, adding more liquid as necessary. Remove once it
 reaches 130&deg;F for medium-rare, checking in several places. Total cooking
 time should be less than 1.5 hours.
 
 1. Let rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve with vegetables and pan juices
 and garnish with additional rosemary.
